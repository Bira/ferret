= Ferret

Ferret is a Ruby port of the Java Lucene search engine.
(http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/) In the same way as Lucene, it is not a
standalone application, but a library you can use to index documents and
search for things in them later.

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8
* (C compiler to build the extension but not required to use Ferret)

== Installation

De-compress the archive and enter its top directory.

  tar zxpvf ferret-0.1.tar.gz
  cd ferret-0.1

Then to compile the C extension type:

  $ ruby setup.rb config
  $ ruby setup.rb setup

If you don't have a C compiler, never mind. Just go straight to the next step.
On *nix you'll need to run this with root privalages. Type;

  # ruby setup.rb install
  
These simple steps install ferret in the default location of Ruby libraries.
You can also install files into your favorite directory by supplying setup.rb
some options. Try;

 $ ruby setup.rb --help


== Usage

You can read the TUTORIAL which you'll find in the same directory as this
README. You can also check the following modules for more specific
documentation.

* Ferret::Analysis: for more information on how the data is processed when it
  is tokenized. There are a number of things you can do with your data such as
  adding stop lists or perhaps a porter stemmer. There are also a number of
  analyzers already available and it is almost trivial to create a new one
  with a simple regular expression.

* Ferret::Search: for more information on querying the index. There are a
  number of already available queries and it's unlikely you'll need to create
  your own. You may however want to take advantage of the sorting or filtering
  abilities of Ferret to present your data the best way you see fit.

* Ferret::Document: to find out how to create documents. This part of Ferret
  is relatively straightforward. The main thing that we haven't gone into here
  is the use of term vectors. These allow you to store and retrieve the
  positions and offsets of the data which can be very useful in document
  comparison amoung other things.  == More information

* Ferret::QueryParser: if you want to find out more about what you can do with
  Ferret's Query Parser, this is the place to look. The query parser is one
  area that could use a bit of work so please send your suggestions.

* Ferret::Index: for more advanced access to the index you'll probably want to
  use the Ferret::Index::IndexWriter and Ferret::Index::IndexReader. This is
  the place to look for more information on them.

* Ferret::Store: This is the module used to access the actual index storage
  and won't be of much interest to most people.

=== Performance

Currently Ferret is an order of magnitude slower than Java Lucene which can be
quite a pain at times. I have written some basic C extensions which may or may
not have installed when you installed Ferret. These double the speed but still
leave it a lot slower than the Java version. I have, however, ported the
indexing part of Java Lucene to C and it is an order of magnitude faster then
the Java version. Once I'm pretty certain that the API of Ferret has settled
and won't be changing much, I'll intergrate my C version. So expect to see
Ferret running faster than Java Lucene some time in the future. If you'd like
to try cferret and test my claims, let me know (if you haven't already found
it in my subversion repository). It's not currently portable and will probably
only run on linux.

== Contact

Bug reports, patches, queries, discussion etc should be addressed to
the mailing list. More information on the list can be found at:

Of course, since Ferret is almost a straight port of Java Lucene,
everything said about Lucene at http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/ should
be true about Ferret. Apart from the bits about it being in Java.
